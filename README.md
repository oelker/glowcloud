# Glowcloud
This repo contains code for a wearable technology project I have been 
working on off and on for a decade, now finally under some #$%*& version 
control. 

# ALL HAIL THE GLOW CLOUD

Inspired by https://www.welcometonightvale.com/, Glowcloud is a hat 
made to imitate the look of THE GLOW CLOUD, a recurring character which is 
an animate multicolored clowd. This repo does not include an 
implementation of forcing others to intone ALL HAIL, dropping of dead 
animals from THE GLOW CLOUD, or running for school board. 

# Hardware

Glowcloud runs on an Adafruit Gemma board, which is wired to an 
addressable LED light string. The light string's colored wires are covered 
in white duct tape and affixed with wire to the top of a white sun hat. A 
microswitch is wired to the board to provide access to switching logic, 
and is housed in a 3D printed holder from [add later]. 

# Costume build

Version 1.0 of the costume build was made of tissue paper, tape, spray 
adhesive, and polyfill. It was heavy and hot. 

Version 2.0 is built on a white canvas sun hat. Atop the hat is a clump of 
wide wired ribbon in white with iridescent strands, arranged in loops and 
cinched with white pipe cleaner to resemble the puffs of a cloud. The 
armature this makes extends past the edges of the sun hat and gives a 
height of roughly ten inches above the sun hat at some points. The ribbon 
structure is topped with a layer of white tulle remnant with tiny 
crystalline plastic dots on it, which is tucked around the ribbon in some 
spots, trailing loose in some spots, and adjustable as needed. White pipe 
cleaners affix the armature to the hat in some spots, and little loops of 
wire attach it in other spots.
